"Sweet Home Alabama"

Big wheels keep on turning <br />
Carry me home to see my kin <br />
Singing songs about the Southland <br />
I miss Alabamy once again <br />
And I think its a sin, yes <br />

Well I heard mister Young sing about her <br />
Well, I heard ole Neil put her down <br />
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember <br />
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow<br />

Sweet home Alabama <br />
Where the skies are so blue <br />
Sweet Home Alabama <br />
Lord, I'm coming home to you<br />

In Birmingham they love the gov' nor (boo, boo, boo)<br />
Now we all did what we could do <br />
Now Watergate does not bother me <br />
Does your conscience bother you? <br />
Tell the truth<br />

Sweet home Alabama <br />
Where the skies are so blue <br />
Sweet Home Alabama <br />
Lord, I'm coming home to you <br />
Here I come Alabama<br />

Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers <br />
And they've been known to pick a song or two <br />
Lord they get me off so much <br />
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue <br />
Now how about you?<br />

Sweet home Alabama <br />
Where the skies are so blue <br />
Sweet Home Alabama <br />
Lord, I'm coming home to you<br />

Sweet home Alabama <br />
Oh sweet home baby <br />
Where the skies are so blue <br />
And the guv'nor's true <br />
Sweet Home Alabama <br />
Lordy <br />
Lord, I'm coming home to you <br />
Yea, yea Montgomery's got the answer...<br />
